     * Creates an alternate 'NxtMotorControllerOnI2cDevice' DCMotorController implementation for
     * a legacy HiTechnic / Nxt motor controller. NxtMotorControllerOnI2cDevice is implemented
     * on top of an {@link II2cDeviceClient} instance which completely handles all the complexities
     * of read vs write mode switching and the like, allowing the logic of the controller itself
     * to be extraordinarily simple. NxtMotorControllerOnI2cDevice is currently experimental,
     * alpha-quality code.
     *
     * <p>The key fact about NxtMotorControllerOnI2cDevice is that manual mode switching is
     * entirely unnecessary. Just call the getPosition() or setPower() methods or what have you,
     * and the mode switching will be taken care of.</p>
     *
     * <p>NxtMotorControllerOnI2cDevice not tied to SynchronousOpMode. It can also be used for example
     * from LinearOpMode, or, indeed, any thread that can tolerate operations that can take tens of
     * milliseconds to run. In SynchronousOpMode, NxtMotorControllerOnI2cDevice is currently
     * enabled by setting the {@link SynchronousOpMode#useExperimentalThunking useExperimentalThunking} flag,
     * though that will probably change. In other OpModes, you'll have to manually
     * call {@link #createNxtDcMotorController createNxtDcMotorControllerOnI2cDevice()} yourself.</p>
     *
     * <p>If you call this method to retrieve a NxtMotorControllerOnI2cDevice, you should
     * call {@link DcMotorController#close()} when you want the controller to
     * close down, likely from your stop() logic or the end of your runOpMode() method as the
     * case may be. In SynchronousOpMode with the {@link SynchronousOpMode#useExperimentalThunking useExperimentalThunking}
     * flag, closing the controller is automaticlly taken care of.</p>
     *
     * <p>{@link #createNxtDcMotorController createNxtDcMotorControllerOnI2cDevice()} takes
     * a ModernRoboticsNxtDcMotorController motor controller as might found in an OpMode's hardware map
     * and converts that into an NxtDcMotorControllerOnI2cDevice. As a side effect of doing so, the
     * ModernRoboticsNxtDcMotorController is disabled, as only one object can be managing the
     * controller at a given time. That importantly also means that any DcMotor objects from
     * the hardware map that were on that controller will need to be recreated. This can be accomplished by calling</p>
     *
     * <code>new DcMotor(controller, portNumber, direction)</code>
     *
     * <p>where controller is the new NxtMotorControllerOnI2cDevice instance and portNumber and
     * direction were retreived from the old, now non-functional DcMotor using getPortNumber()
     * and getDirection() respectively.</p>
     *
     * @param target the ModernRoboticsNxtDcMotorController we are to convert
     * @return an NxtMotorControllerOnI2cDevice, or null if target was not a legacy motor controller
